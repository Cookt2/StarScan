Task: Application designed to locate/identify constellations in an image of the night sky

Target Platform: OSX High Sierra 10.13.3
Language: C++ utlizing OPENCV/Qt

Accomplished:
    - researched and obtained starter data set
    - theorized and implemented star filter
    - theorized and implemented constellation scanning algorithm
    - designed and implemented basic GUI
    - added features: filter restriction, constellation restriction,
                                 visual mode, and debug mode
                                 
TODO:
    - write documentation (how to use)
    - enchance scanning ablility (make search algorithm smarter)
